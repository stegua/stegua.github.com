Last week, more then 700.000 Italian commuters discovered the importance of Operations Research (OR).
Nobody explicitly mentioned OR, 
but due to a horrible crew schedule of [Trenord](http://www.trenord.it) (a train operator),
the commuters had a **long, long, long nightmare**. 
During all the week, several trains were cancelled and most of the trains were delayed.
A [newspaper](//http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/12_dicembre_11/treni-cronaca-caos-episodi-2113111724378.shtml) wrote that a commuter waiting to go home had the sad record of 11 consecutive trains cancelled.
The Italian edition of Wired has an [article about this horrible week](http://daily.wired.it/news/tech/2012/12/13/trenord-treni-software-caos-85247.html).
If you want to get an idea of the chaos you can search for "caos tilt software trenord" on google.it.

Trenord officially said that the software that planned the crew schedule is faulty. 
The software was bought last year from [Goal System](http://www.goalsystem.com) a Spanish company.
Rumors say that Lenord paid the Goal System around **1.500.000 euro**.
Likely, the system is not faulty, but it had "_only_" bad input data.

## What newspaper do not write

Before Goal System, Lenord was using a different software, produced by [M.A.I.O.R. srl](http://www.maior.it),
that is used by most of the public transportation companies in Italy,
included [ATM](http://www.atm.it) that operates the subway and buses in Milan. 
Honestly, I am biased, since I collaborate with MAIOR. However, last June, Lenord kicked MAOIR out of its business
without any reason and without any complain on its software: it had just bought the Goal System.

Newspaper do not cover the following two questions:

1. Why to change software if the previous one was working correctly?

2. With the Italian economical crisis, why to invest 1.500.000 euro into a Spanish company, while there
is an Italian software house that produces an excellent scheduler and collaborate with Italian OR research
groups at Politecnico di Milano and University of Pisa?

### MAIOR is back
Likely, next week will be better for 700,000 commuters,
since OR experts from MAIOR are traveling to Milan to re-schedule everything.
