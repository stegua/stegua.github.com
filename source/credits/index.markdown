This blog was started after several discussions with my friend and coauthor
<a href="https://plus.google.com/116327072470709585073">Stefano Coniglio</a>
who always proofreads my posts. 
Though I have not convinced him to write a guest post yet,
he is a contributor of this blog: thanks Stefano!

Another friend and coauthor that supports this blog is <a href="http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~marco">Marco Chiarandini</a>.
I do not know how he finds the time to proofread my posts, but he does, with the same
seriousness as he were reviewing a paper: thanks Marco!
